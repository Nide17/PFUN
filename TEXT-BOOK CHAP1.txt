- Java Standard Edition contains the capabilities needed to develop desktop and server applications. 

- Before Java SE 8, Java supported three programming paradigms:

    - Procedural programming,
    - Object-oriented programming and
    - Generic programming.

- Java SE 8 added the beginnings of functional programming with lambdas and streams. 

- The Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) is geared toward developing large-scale, distributed networking applications and web-based applications.

- The Java Micro Edition (Java ME)—a subset of Java SE—is geared toward developing applications for resource-constrained embedded devices, such as smartwatches, television set-top boxes, smart meters (for monitoring electric energy usage), and more.

- Moore's law: Every year or two, the capacities of computers have approximately doubled inexpensively. Capacities are doubled while the cost reduces by half.

- Programmers began using English-like abbreviations to represent elementary operations. These abbreviations formed the basis of assembly languages. Translator programs called assemblers were developed to convert early assembly-language programs to machine language at computer speeds.

- From the programmer’s standpoint, high-level languages are preferable to machine and assembly languages. Java is the world’s most widely used high-level programming language.

- CLASS: blueprints: car drawings: engineering drawings
- OBJECTS: Instance of the car: building a car
- INSTANTIATION: Building a car object
- Driving a car: To use an class's methods

- Attributes of objects are specified by the class’s instance variables.

- Classes (and their objects) encapsulate, i.e., encase, their attributes and methods.

- Collections of related methods that typically enable you to tell objects what to do, but not how to do it

- UML: Single graphical language for communicating the results of any OOAD (object-oriented analysis-and-design) process.
