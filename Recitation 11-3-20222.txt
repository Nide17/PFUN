- Overloading: Using the method using with different parameters.
- Overriding: using the method inherited from the parent class, add its implementation: inheriting it, then try to change its implementation.

Polymorphism: behaving in many forms: method or object

Two types:
- Compile-time polymorphism (method overloading)
- Runtime polymorphism (method overriding)

To be able to override: Animal cat = new Cat();

Encapsulation: getters and setters to access hidden things
Interface: for implementing abstracted things

- When you are implementing interface methods, you can implement them differently.
