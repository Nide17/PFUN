*difference between class and interface

1. The interfaces are used in java to implementing 
the concept of multiple inheritence whereas classes 
are not used to implement multiple inheriyence. 

2. We are not allocating the memory for the 
interfaces whereas the memory is allocated for
the classes

3. Interfaces are always implemented whereas clases 
are always extended
