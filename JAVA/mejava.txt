final: means this is a constant and cannot be changed
eg: public static final double PI=3.14;

 some changes to another components

encapsulation; process of binding the data members with 
corresponding services/methods.

a component having data hiding and abstraction feature, then it is encapsulated

eg;
class Gmail{
static private String un = ocjp;
static private String pwd= ocjp;

static public String getLogin(String u, String p){
 
if (un.equals(u)  && pwd.equals(p))
return  "success login";
else 
return  "fail login";
}
}
 
class DrivenCode
{
pp s v m()
{
sop(gmail.getlogin("ocjp","ocjp");
}
}
